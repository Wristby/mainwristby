No mobile-first constraints.Theme: Professional "Dark Mode" (Slate and Charcoal) with "Emerald Green" for profit metrics and "Amber" for aging inventory.Navigation: A permanent left-hand sidebar with the following sections: Dashboard, Inventory, CRM, Logistics, and Financials.2. Core Database Schema & TablesInventory Table: ID, Image (URL), Brand, Model, Reference #, Serial #, Buy Price, Service/Polishing Cost, Status (Sourcing, In-Service, Listed, Sold), Purchase Date, Sold Date, Hold Time (Calculated).CRM Table: Client Name, Contact Info, Purchase History, "Want List" (Brands/Models they are looking for).Expenses Table: Monthly overheads (Insurance, Tools, Subscriptions).3.
